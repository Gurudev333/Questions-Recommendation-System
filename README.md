# Questions-Recommender-System
•For computative propramming choising correct problem is tedesieous task for programmer. Depending on the speed 
of programmer, expertise level and number of correct attempts, time taking to solve problem & so on,the corresponding
problem is recommended.</br>
•The goal is to build a model that will predict range of attempts a user will make to solve problem depending on the user current status and problem difficulty.</br>
•Used build item popularity, item similarity, Item content Model, Matrix factorization algorithms.</br>
• packages used are GraphLab, NumPy, Pandas.</br>


# Techniques
I used different types of models for checking the performance
1.Popularity Based</br>
2.Matrix Factorization</br>
3.Item Similarity</br>
4.Item-Content-Similarity</br>
The Question notebook contains all the code for all the models another contains their indiviual reprsentation.</br></br></br>

The tool(package) used is GraphLab with python 2.x (GraphLab Laucher provide all facility)
